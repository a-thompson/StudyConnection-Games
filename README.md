# StudyConnection-Games Vertical Prototype
### Overview
*For a class project, I designed the Games section of a study app called Study Connection.*
>Users may select one or combine several study sets to play games.  The three games are meant to provide a variety of methods to study.  For example, Match is best used when studying short terms and Test is best used when studying more complex concepts.  Match and Test help a student study via recognition, while Memory helps a student study via recall.

>I included an Audio option so visually impaired users may use the study game.  When Audio is on, minor changes, such as double clicks, are added to improve the usability.  Memory also includes several ways to input an answer: including text input and a quick-play version where the user input if they were correct after they see the answer.

>Initial tester feedback from my initial concept design suggested I create a game similar to a test, so the app may be usable for classes with more complex concepts.  The final vertical prototype is able to take multiple points from a topic, or points from several different topics, to create effective multiple choice questions.

>Features improved from the clickable wireframe include navigation, intuitivity, and modality.  When buttons were not intuitive, the user would often not know what to do and need instruction.  I focused on improving visibility of tasks on my vertical prototype, by including backgrounds in buttons, as well as more labels.  The carousel now has a picture hanging off the page frame, so a user knows they may scroll with it.  The Memory app also had its multi-modality improved, as I created quick-play buttons.  The Match app was also improved to add a de-select option.  The audio button was added to the home page so a user can control the sound for the entire app in an easy to find location.
